# Solid-Texture-Synthesis
Texture synthesis is an interesting and important problem in the field of computer graphics and is one of the most essential techniques for realistic image synthesis. In this repository, we will implement a method for synthesizing a 3D solid texture from a 2D exemplar, based on the paper Solid Texture Synthesis from 2D Exemplars (Kopf et al. 2007)
